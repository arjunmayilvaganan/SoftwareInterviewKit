# System Design Interview Preparation

## Overview

System design interviews assess your ability to design large-scale distributed systems. They evaluate your technical knowledge, communication skills, and ability to make appropriate trade-offs.

## Key Topics

### Scalability
- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**: Understanding when to add more servers versus when to upgrade existing servers
- **Load Distribution**: Methods for distributing traffic across servers

### Data Management
- **Database Selection**: Relational vs. NoSQL, considerations for each type
- **Data Partitioning/Sharding**: Strategies for distributing data across multiple databases
- **Replication**: Master-slave, multi-master configurations

### System Components
- **Load Balancers**: Types, algorithms, failure handling
- **Caching**: Strategies, invalidation techniques, distributed caches
- **CDNs**: Content delivery networks for static content distribution
- **API Gateways**: Design considerations, rate limiting, authentication

### Architecture Patterns
- **Microservices**: Benefits, drawbacks, communication patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Pub/sub systems, message queues
- **Serverless Architecture**: Use cases and limitations

### Reliability Engineering
- **Fault Tolerance**: Designing for component failures
- **Redundancy**: Active-active vs. active-passive strategies
- **Disaster Recovery**: RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

## Common System Design Questions

### URL Shortening Service (like bit.ly)
- **Key Requirements**: Generate short URLs, redirect to original URLs, analytics
- **Challenges**: Hash function design, collision handling, read-heavy workload

### Social Media Feed
- **Key Requirements**: Post creation, feed generation, real-time updates
- **Challenges**: Feed aggregation, consistency vs. availability tradeoffs

### File Storage System (like Dropbox)
- **Key Requirements**: File upload/download, synchronization, sharing
- **Challenges**: Large file handling, deduplication, metadata management

### Notification System
- **Key Requirements**: Different notification types, delivery guarantees
- **Challenges**: Real-time delivery, handling recipient preferences

### Ride-sharing Service (like Uber)
- **Key Requirements**: Matching riders and drivers, ETA calculation, pricing
- **Challenges**: Real-time location tracking, surge pricing, geographic partitioning

### Rate Limiter
- **Key Requirements**: Limit requests per user/client
- **Challenges**: Distributed counting, sliding window implementation

## Approach Framework

1. **Clarify Requirements (1-2 minutes)**
   - Functional requirements: What should the system do?
   - Non-functional requirements: Performance, reliability, scalability needs
   - Constraints: Traffic volume, data size, latency requirements

2. **High-Level Design (5-10 minutes)**
   - Core components and their interactions
   - API design: Key endpoints, parameters, response structures
   - Data models: Entities and relationships

3. **Detailed Design (10-15 minutes)**
   - Scaling strategies for different components
   - Data storage approaches and schema design
   - Handling special cases and edge conditions

4. **Bottleneck Analysis (3-5 minutes)**
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Propose solutions and improvements
   - Discuss monitoring and alerting considerations

5. **Summary and Trade-offs (2-3 minutes)**
   - Recap the key design decisions
   - Discuss alternatives considered and trade-offs made
   - Potential future improvements
