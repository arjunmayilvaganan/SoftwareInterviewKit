# Software Engineer Interview Kit

A curated collection of resources, topics, and content for software engineering interview preparation. This repository focuses on non-algorithmic aspects of technical interviews, including system design, behavioral questions, engineering practices, and domain-specific knowledge.

## Contents

- [System Design](/system-design/README.md): Concepts, examples, and resources for system design interviews
- [Behavioral](/behavioral/README.md): Common behavioral questions and frameworks for effective answers
- [Engineering Practices](/engineering-practices/README.md): Topics on software engineering principles, patterns, and best practices
- [Domain Knowledge](/domain-knowledge/README.md): Resources for specific technologies and domains

## Purpose

This repository serves as a knowledge base for software engineering interview preparation, specifically excluding data structures and algorithms which are covered extensively elsewhere.

## Getting Started

To make the best use of this repository:

1. **Assess Your Interview Timeline**: If you have interviews coming up within 1-2 weeks, focus on the specific sections most relevant to the role. If you have more time, work through each section methodically.

2. **Understand the Company**: Research the company you're interviewing with to determine which sections to prioritize. Different companies emphasize different aspects of engineering knowledge.

3. **Practice Articulation**: Technical knowledge alone isn't enough; practice explaining concepts clearly and concisely. Consider recording yourself or practicing with peers.

4. **Customize Your Preparation**: Use this repository as a foundation, but tailor your preparation to the specific role you're targeting.
